What is Iluminum?
----------------

Iluminum is a digital currency that enables anonymous, instant
payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Iluminum uses peer-to-peer technology
to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money
are carried out collectively by the network. Iluminum Core is built with Dash Core open
source software which enables the use of this currency.
